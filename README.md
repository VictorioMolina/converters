# Converters

This repository contains two simple Python scripts for converting between image formats and converting GIF files to MP4 videos. These scripts utilize popular Python libraries, MoviePy and ImageIO.

## Features

1. **GIF to MP4 Converter**: Convert GIF files to MP4 videos using MoviePy.

2. **Images to GIF Converter**: Convert a series of images (e.g., PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, BMP) into a GIF animation using ImageIO.

## Prerequisites

Before using these scripts, you'll need to have the following installed:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [MoviePy](https://zulko.github.io/moviepy/)
- [ImageIO](https://imageio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html)

## Usage

### GIF to MP4 Converter

To convert a GIF to an MP4 video, run the following command:

```bash
python gif_to_mp4.py
```

Follow the prompts to provide the input GIF path and the output MP4 path.

### Images to GIF Converter
